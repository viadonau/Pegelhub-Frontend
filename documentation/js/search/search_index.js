project.\nArchitecural Overview\n\nTheming\nThe application provides theming support in two different ways:\n\ntheme.scss\nbase-theme.scss\n\ntheme.scss\nThe main theme file provides scss-variables used for coloring and shaping HTML elements. In order to change these parameters, the actual values need to be provided for the given SCSS variables.\nbase-theme.scss\nThis is the PrimeNG main theme which is responsible for the general styling of the application. Here, changes can be done to the PrimeNG style classes and rules.\nDeployment\nTo deploy the application on a web server, follow the instructions below. The application is deployed and made available in a docker container.\nPrerequisites\nMake sure that the following software is installed on your system:\n\nDocker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/get-started\n\nConfigure Environment\n\nIn Angular, environments are used to define which configuration should be used for which environment.\nThe following environment file is used for the deployment via Docker: environment.prod.ts\nInside this particular file the endpoint of the API is stored in the variable BASE_URL.\n\nInvolved files\n\nNavigate to the root directory of your Angular app.\nHere we find a docker-compose.yml file and a Dockerfile which are both needed for a functioning deployment.\ndocker-compose.yml defines which containers are to be created\nDockerfile defines a series of commands that initiate the build, copy the resulting source and finally start the container.\n\nStartup Procedure\n\nStart Docker Desktop on your local machine and wait until it has booted successfully.\nAfterward the container can be built with the command docker-compose build. This will take some time depending on the power of your system.\nIt is finished once the docker image nginx appears in the Images section of Docker Desktop.\nYou can then start it with docker-compose up or stop it with docker-compose down.\nTo make sure the application is running correctly, take a look at Containers inside Docker Desktop. Here you should see the container pegelhub-frontend and a green icon on the left.\nAfter the container has been successfully started with docker-compose up, the application is accessible under port 80.\n\nRunning the application locally\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning End-to-End Tests\nRun ng test:e2e to execute the e2e tests via Cypress.\nRunning Component tests\nRun ng test:comp to execute the component tests via Cypress.\nCompodoc\nServes as a documentation tool for this Angular application.\nBased on the source code it generates a good-looking and easy-to-understand documentation that is easily accessible.\nBuild\nExecute the command ng compodoc:build to generate the documentation.\nServe\nExecute the command ng compodoc:serve to serve the documentation and gain access to it.\nThe documentation should be available on port 8080.\nNote\nThe build command should always be executed before starting with the serve procedure.\nIf this is not the case, the documentation will not be accessible.\nBuild and Serve (combined)\nExecute the command ng compodoc:build-and-serve to combine the build and serve procedures into one step.\nHighcharts\nRepresents a JavaScript charting library based on SVG and some canvas/WebGL.\nUsed to show all kind of diagrams and charts across the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
