Overview\n\nDeployment\nTo deploy the application on a web server, follow the instructions below. the application is deployed and made available in a docker container.\nPrerequisites\nMake sure that the following software is installed on your system:\n\nDocker Desktop https://www.docker.com/get-started\nDocker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install\n\nConfigure Environment\n\nIn angular, environments are used to define which configuration should be used for which environment.\nThe following environment file is used for deployment via docker: environment.prod.ts\nAmong other things, the end point of the API is stored in the variable BASE_URL.\n\nStep 1:\n\nNavigate to the root directory of your Angular app.\nHere we find a docker-compose.yml file and a Dockerfile, which are needed for deployment.\nThe docker-compose.yml file refers to the Dockerfile. While the docker-compose.yml file defines which containers are to be created, the Dockerfile defines a series of commands that initiate the build, copy the resulting source and finally start the container.\n\nStep 2:\n\nThe container can be built with the command docker-compose build. You can then start it with docker-compose up or stop it with docker-compose down.\nAfter the container has been started with docker-compose up, the application is accessible under port 80.\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
